# Editing diagrams

All diagrams' sources are stored in `.drawio.svg` files â€” _SVG files with embedded Diagrams.net content_. They are made using [Diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net) (formerly Draw.io).

The recommended way to edit these files locally is with [Visual Studio Code's Draw.io integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio).

If you want to use Diagram.net's web app instead of the Visual Studio Code integration, then be sure to save it by exporting the diagram as SVG, using the following settings:

 * Zoom: 110%
 * Border width: 12
 * Check: Transparent Background
 * Uncheck: Include a copy of my diagram
