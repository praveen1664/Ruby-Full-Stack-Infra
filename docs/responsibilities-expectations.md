# Responsibilities & expectations

Joining the team means assuming one or more of the following responsibilities:

 * Investigating and fixing urgent issues and down time.
 * Ensuring that infrastructure components stay healthy and secure.
 * Ensuring that the content in the issue tracker stays up-to-date, relevant and high-quality.
 * Handling support requests from developers.
 * Reviewing infrastructure pull requests.
 * Ensuring that community interactions follow our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
 * Providing [mentorship](mentorship.md) to contributors and fellow team members.

<!-- NOTE: please keep this list in sync with .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/apply_join_team.md -->

You do not need to be an expert on all the areas that we deal with. It's fine if your skills on one or more areas is entry-level, as long as you are curious and want to learn. That's why team members mentor each other.

You don't need to assume all responsibilities at once, nor do you need to be available at all times. You are free to decide how much time you are willing to invest as a team member, and you are free to leave whenever you want.

Our goal is to build a resilient team by having many members cover for each other, even if they individually only have limited time resources.

But at the very least, we expect that you are responsive for contact, and that you are at least occasionally available to help.
